📋 How CGPA is Calculated
The CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) is calculated based on the grades you achieve in each subject and their corresponding credits. Here’s how it works:

Formula:
CGPA = (Total Grade Points in all Semesters) / (Total Credits in all Semesters)

GPA for each semester is calculated using:

GPA = (Sum of [Grade Points × Credits]) / (Sum of Credits)
Grade Points Table
Grade	Grade Points	Credits
O	10	Depends on the subject (typically 3 or 4 credits)
A+	9	Depends on the subject
A	8	Depends on the subject
B+	7	Depends on the subject
B	6	Depends on the subject
RA	0	-
The grades are assigned based on the marks obtained in each subject.
Multiply the grade point by the corresponding credit hours to get the grade point for each subject.
Sum the grade points for all subjects and divide by the total credits to get the GPA for the semester.
The CGPA is the average of all semester GPAs, weighted by credits.
